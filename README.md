# mastodon-to-neocities
A method for importing your Mastodon feed into your Neocities site via .rss (workaround for Neocities' CSP restricting direct linking to external .rss)

# Todo:
Local method of reducing down .rss feed to 'x most recent toots' - Save server space and threadwork, if a page is only displaying the 4 most recent toots, therefore doesn't need to download the whole feed. See: https://tsxyz.neocities.org homepage
